# React Router Tutorials

This is a repo containing my projects made with package libray React Router version 5 and 6.  
React Router is a react library for handling browser routes and rendering different components based on a route.

# _ReactRouteBeginnings_ folder project

This folder contains a project with the basics of react router version 5, for example `<Route></Route>` component.

# _ReactRouteProject_ folder project

This folder contains a react real world application project using react router version 5. This project is a quotes recopilator, we add different quotes to a list of quotes, for each quote we can push different comments, all this information is loaded from firebase real time database.

# _ReactRouterV6_ folder project

This folder is the upgrade from react router version 5 to 6, we use as an example the `ReactRouteProject` folder.
